thesis topic :object detection with active learning strategies.
-train the custom dataset with baseline model as yolov5 with dropout layers activated.
-save the results of the run.
-use that weights for mc dropout inference with model.test.
-select the high uncertainity or less confidence predictions top 10 or 20.
-send those for human to annotate.
-train the pretained model with added annotated images from human.  
repeat process.



need to discuss with joed:
train with mc dropout applied or without during intial stage
